-- More complex clauses can be constructed by joining numerous AND or OR logical keywords (ie. num_wheels >= 4 AND doors <= 2). 
-- And below are some useful operators that you can use for numerical data (ie. integer or floating point):

Operator	                     Condition	                                          SQL Example

=, !=, <, <=, >, >=	 Standard numerical operators	                          col_name != 4
BETWEEN … AND …	     Number is within range of two values (inclusive)	      col_name BETWEEN 1.5 AND 10.5
NOT BETWEEN … AND …	 Number is not within range of two values (inclusive)     col_name NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 10
IN (…)	             Number exists in a list	                              col_name IN (2, 4, 6)
NOT IN (…)	         Number does not exist in a list	                      col_name NOT IN (1, 3, 5)

=> SQL doesnt require you to write the keywords all capitalized

Operator	                      Condition	                                                                        Example
=	                 Case sensitive exact string comparison (notice the single equals)	                       col_name = "abc"
!= or <>	         Case sensitive exact string inequality comparison	                                       col_name != "abcd"
LIKE	             Case insensitive exact string comparison	                                               col_name LIKE "ABC"
NOT LIKE	         Case insensitive exact string inequality comparison	                                   col_name NOT LIKE "ABCD"
%	                 Used anywhere in a string to match a sequence of zero or more characters 
                     (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE)	                                                           col_name LIKE "%AT%"
                                                                                                               (matches "AT", "ATTIC", "CAT" or even "BATS")
_	                 Used anywhere in a string to match a single character (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE)	       col_name LIKE "AN_"
                                                                                                               (matches "AND", but not "AN")
IN (…)	             String exists in a list	                                                               col_name IN ("A", "B", "C")
NOT IN (…)	         String does not exist in a list	                                                       col_name NOT IN ("D", "E", "F")
